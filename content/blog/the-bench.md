## Musings on the time spent between projects

"Free" time between projects can be both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you have time to finally do that thing you wanted to do... yay! On the other, you might have waaay more time than it takes to do that thing... what do you do with the rest of the time?

Enter Reddit.

JK... obviously.

## Time well spent

How you choose to spend time between projects is up to you. You want to use this time productively of course, and you also don't want to be bored to death reading through tutorial after tutorial after tutorial... One can only make so many todo-list apps in one sitting, before something cracks.

It's easy to slip into bad habits when you're not on a project, but it's important for your personal and professional development that you use this time constructively. You may want to learn a new technology or perhaps improve your skills in one you already know, or maybe you just want to improve... just generally.

I've personally had each of these goals in my head at one point or another when I've been between projects. I know how difficult it can be to maintain motivation and focus when your only goals are those you've set for yourself, and those goals are a little bit vague... Be honest; they are pretty vague, aren't they?

So here is my guide to using the time you have between projects as constructively as possible, whilst hopefully maintaining your sanity. It's primarily targeted towards developers, but hopefully there will be a few things to take away for those in other roles too.

## TIP 1: Short term goals

The quantity of work you set out for yourself to achieve whilst on the bench is largely dependent on how long you're going to have before starting on your next project. Quite often this amount of time may be unknown to you, or may be based purely on rough estimates.

This is why, in my opinion, it's good to work in small increments, such that if you suddenly find that your "free" time is being cut short, you will still have achieved something of worth.

By this I mean; if you think you're going to have, say, four weeks until starting your next project, it might occur to you to set out enough work at the outset to keep yourself busy for the full four weeks. However, then if your "free" time is cut short at three weeks, the work you set out to do will be unfinished and all you'll have to show for that time is a partially complete _thing_. This is a very dissatisfying feeling, in case you've never experienced it.

So, to avoid this; I've adopted the "Work in chunks"<sup>1</sup> methodology. If you have about four weeks; set one goal at time, which will each take less than 1 week to achieve. This isn't a new idea. As developers you should be familiar with the concept of breaking down a sizable piece of work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Especially if you work in an agile way, e.g. scrum, and aim to deliver a potentially shippable piece of work every sprint. I try to apply that same principle to the ultimate outcome that I want to take away from any period I spend on the bench. When I think: "I want to be better at X before I start my next project.", my next thought is usually: "How can I break that down into chunks, which each have their own worthwhile outcome?". Aim for progress, not perfection.

> <sup>1</sup>This is a working title... try not to judge.

#### Example:

You have about a month and want to improve your knowledge of current front-end web technologies. You've heard a lot of hype around: React, Redux, etc.

##### 1: Get an overview

I personally like to get an overview of any new technologies I'm interested in, before diving in. That way, I have a better idea of the order in which I should proceed.

I'll let you use your own initiative on how to go about doing this.

##### 2: Take one step at a time

- Start by working through a react tutorial. (Links at the end of the post)

  If your time is cut short now, you have a basic knowledge of React. Well Done.

- Take a few days and create a project based on what you learned, or further develop the project from the tutorial where appropriate.

  If your time is cut short now, you have improved your knowledge of React. Well Done.

- Then work through a Redux tutorial. (Links at the end of the post)

  If your time is cut short now, you have gained a basic working knowledge of Redux. Well Done.

...aaand so on.

##### 3: There is no three

EOM

You can see why I think this approach is better than diving in and starting up a full-blown React and Redux project from scratch. By taking the incremental approach, not only do you safeguard your learning against unforeseen time constraints, you also gain a better understanding of how one technology relates to, and/or builds upon the other.

As I said before though, there's nothing new there. Most of this might seem like common sense, and maybe you approach your "free" time like this already. Good for you.

## TIP 2: Keep Busy

> The internet makes work for idle devs.

The modern world is full of distractions, and if you're reading this; then, odds are, you're currently sitting in front of the greatest distraction generator known to man. Unless you got this post printed out for some reason... but who does that?!

Anyway...

If, like me, you have a mind that has a tendency to float from one place to another without your permission; then this guide will hopefully help you to either maintain focus, or at the very least, train your lack of focus to be more useful.

#### Improve your productivity

I'm not going to go into detail on this one. There are a ton of different approaches to improving one's productivity, and many more blog posts and articles describing the virtues of each of them. So I'll entrust you to do you're own research here.

I've linked a presentation at the end of this post that I found useful, but this might not work for you. Different strokes for different folks, and all that.

#### Sidequests

The makers of videogames are generally quite a smart bunch. They know that forcing yourself to focus on a task, or the steps towards completing a task, for too long will result in a mental mutiny. So they introduced the concept of sidequests; little tasks that you can do for a change of pace, to stop you from losing interest in the main task.

So I'm going to shamelessly rip off the concept and apply it to the subject of this post.

To that end; if you find that your mind is wandering despite the steps you've taken to improve your productivity, then it might be a good time for you to set yourself some sidequests. There are, no-doubt, tons of little things that need doing at your place of work, or just little things that need doing in general for your own work. Whether that be helping to plan the office party, or going through and tidying up some files on your computer that you haven't touched in months; just take a couple of minutes to jot some of these down somewhere convenient. Then, whenever you feel your attention wandering away from one of your primary goals, pick one of these up and get it done to take your mind off of the primary objective for a while.

I'm calling this approach "sidequests" but it's also quite commonly referred to as some variation on: Active or Positive Procrastination. And this concept can be applied elsewhere in your life as well. It is even sometimes appropriate whilst on a project.<sup>2</sup>

> <sup>2</sup> This obviously depends on the nature of the project. Use your own judgement here. As a rule of thumb: never blindly follow something that you read in a blog.

Procrastination, is often referred to as a bad thing, but it can actually be useful. As long as you use the time spent avoiding one thing, to achieve something useful on another thing, then the time hasn't been wasted. However, sooner or later you should always do the thing you were avoiding in the first place. There's a difference between using procrastination productively and just never finishing your primary objective.

Some (two, ok. It's just two) sources in support of this, for all you nay-sayers:

- [Smithsonian magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-procrastination-is-good-for-you-2102008/?no-ist)

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpU-NNQXVG4" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/LpU-NNQXVG4/0.jpg"

> It should go without saying that during work hours these sidequests should all be work related. Planning your next vacation might be an important use of time to you, but your boss probably isn't going to be too happy when they find out that they've been paying you to do it. Again, common sense...never blindly follow something that you read in a blog.

## Tip 3: When you don't know... ask.

What if you are really stuck for ideas of what to do with your time on the bench?

Short answer: Ask someone.

- Ask your manager what technologies are likely to be used on your next project, and brush up on those.

- Ask your peers what areas they think you are currently lacking in, and spend some time working on those.

- Ask your boss if there is any work that's not project related, but that needs doing for the company.

## Long-ish list of ideas of stuff to do!

That's it for the meat of this post. Here's a list of stuff that might just help to keep you occupied when you're between projects.

1. Learn a new programming language.
2. Learn about a tech area, e.g. Big Data.
3. Improve upon your knowledge of a specific language or area.
4. Contribute to open-source projects.
5. Write your own framework, helper library, or other software package.
6. Create a presentation that you can then give to co-workers, on an area that you are particularly competent in or passionate about.
7. Improve your general code-based, problem solving ability with logic exercises and coding challenges.
8. Read about tips, tricks, and other such things in technical blog posts.
9. Work on your softer skills, such as time management or professional communication.
10. Study project management, testing, user experience, deployment, build tools... Or any other development-adjacent topic.
11. Read about or watch presentations about the field of software development in general, and any issues affecting it.
12. ~~Write a blog about how to keep busy on the bench.~~
